# Bugs to be fixed
* /api/v1/pets POST doesn't check for existence of speciality ID. It ignores the ones that do not exist

# To check and verify
* HTTP status codes, especially if I'm using CONFLICT properly
* @Transactional usage
* Cascade types


# If I had more time
* Handle more error reposting cases for REST responses
